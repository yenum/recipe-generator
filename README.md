Phoodie App
Version: 1.3

About the project:
Finding recipes to cook can be overwhelming. A simple google search can help but in the times when you want quick suggestions, Google may overwhelm. Enter Phoodie App!
This web application built in React js, allows the user to find recipes easily by a simple click of a button. It is that simple. Once the button is clicked, the app randomly generates a recipe which the user can use. 

Features of the project:
The user can click the button multiple times and each time the button is clicked, a new recipe is generated with a full recipe card. The recipe card contains a photo of the recipe, serving size, ingredient list and a step by step instruction on how to cook the recipe.

Technical Knowledge used:
In building this application, the recipes and all the data for the recipes were pulled from the Spoonacular API. I made a single call for 100 random recipes and once the data was retrived, it was used to create JSON file in the project. The JSON file then provides the recipe data which the user sees on the application.
